# Bottle Tracker
Used to track feeds for 6 days at a time. I know there are probably many apps that do the same, but i didnt make them myself.

A user can upload and delete feeds. 
A user can set the time if you want to log an earlier bottle.

A daily totals section is displayed at the bottom which shows the total in oz and ml, along with the number of bottles and the average time between bottles.

It is hosted here on github pages.
